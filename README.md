Because I'm a big fan of problem solving and I am always looking for new problems and new platforms to increase my skills, I thought about putting an app to generate a platform so you can simply go there, click on a button and a random platform is generated for you!

After stumbling on a reddit post where the user Neu_Ron had initially fetched a great list of platforms and [shared it on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/c37o7k/a_list_of_all_problem_solving_websites/), I decided to make this app to randomize the platform choice. If you're like me, you like to try different platforms as each platform have their own way to present the problems, so this app can be a nice thing to have around.

Thank you in advance for [contributing](#contribute) to this list of coding-practice platforms so it stays updated!
